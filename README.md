# About pool-pilot

pool-pilot is my pool automation project based around raspberry pi

## Software Installation

1. git clone https://github.com/SeeSpotRun/pool-pilot.git  # clone this repo
2. cd pool-pilot && git submodule init && git submodule update # get submodules
3. cd wiringPi $$ ./build  # compile and install wiringPi

## Hardware

1. A Raspberry Pi (mine is a [pi 2](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-2-model-b/))
2. RF 433MHz modules; a transmitter and receiver (mine are similar to [these](http://i.imgur.com/zqPaiCB.jpg))
3. 433MHz mains standby control sockets (mine are similar to [these](http://www.wattsclever.com/au/products/easy-off-sockets))
4. Valve actuators (http://www.zodiac.com.au/jandy-valve-actuator) and valves
5. 24VAC Transformer to drive the actuators
6. Relays to switch the 24V power to the actuators (I use one of [these](http://www.jaycar.com.au/Kits,-Science-%26-Learning/Science-Lab-Equipment/Instruments/Arduino-Compatible-8-Channel-Relay-Board/p/XC4418))
